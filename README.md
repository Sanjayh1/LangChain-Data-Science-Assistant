# LangChain-Data-Science-Assistant

This repository contains a case study exploring the development of a Data Science Assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and the LangChain framework.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a Generative AI solution that automates some tasks in Data Analysis, Database Querying, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation. This is achieved by enabling LLM to interpret natural language commands and generate the necessary code to execute these tasks.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language to Code Conversion:** Transform user requests into executable code for data operations.

- **Automated Data Analysis:** Streamline various data analysis workflows.

- **Database Interaction:** Query relational databases using natural language commands.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Enhance LLM capabilities by integrating external data retrieval.

## Benefits
- **Time Savings:** Automates repetitive coding tasks in data science.

- **Improved Accuracy:** Reduces human error in code generation.

- **Increased Accessibility:** Empowers users without extensive coding knowledge to perform data analysis.
